Hello teams, volunteers, and friends,

This newsletter contains additional information about the in-person and virtual kickoff experiences on Saturday, September 6th for the 2025–2026 DECODE™ presented by RTX season.

Attending one of these events is the best way to start the season, with opportunities to meet fellow teams, share knowledge, and learn about this year's challenge together. Check [https://flfirst.org/events](https://flfirst.org/events) for the latest event information as it gets published, and look for communication from your local league with instructions for registering and attending.

## Virtual Kickoff

If you can't make it to one of the in-person kickoff sites, we have a live broadcast featuring some new and some familiar faces at [https://www.youtube.com/@FIRSTInFlorida](https://www.youtube.com/@FIRSTInFlorida). The broadcast will begin at 11:30am ET on Saturday, September 6th, and include:

- Welcome message and discussion of the changes to Advancement
- The official game reveal and related videos from FIRST
- Rules commentary from your Florida referees
- Time for Q&A about the game

Join us, won't you?

## Reminder: Call for Videos

What advice would you give teams to get started with the new season? We're looking for 30-second (1 minute maximum) videos with your tips. Topics could include how to evaluate game strategy, how to get started with CAD, or anything else relevant to the start of the season. Here are the guidelines:

- 30-second video (1 minute max)
- Film in landscape (for the broadcast)
- Don't include copyrighted music or video
- Post the videos publicly (e.g. YouTube public or unlisted; Google Drive) and send the link to me by Friday, August 29th.

Florida has a [history](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBXi66IgZNc) of [creative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7UXB_mEEA) videos. We can't guarantee that all submissions will be used in the show, but I'm excited to see what you come up with.

See you soon!
