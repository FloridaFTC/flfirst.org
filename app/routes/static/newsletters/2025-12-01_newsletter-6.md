# 2025–2026 Newsletter #6: Future Florida Championships

Hello Florida _FIRST_ Tech Challenge,

Quick reminder: [Dean’s List Award](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc/deans-list) nominations are due by December 15th.

The rest of this email relates to future seasons of the Florida Championship event and ways you can help. **Short version**: we’re looking for potential venues, and we’re looking for sponsorship opportunities.

As you may know, the Florida Championship event has been at the AdventHealth Fieldhouse in Winter Haven for several years. (We’ll be back on March 6–7, 2026 for this season's event.) The venue, staff, and financial support from _Visit Central Florida_ have been incredible. This is the final year of our standing agreement with them, which means it’s time to consider our options for March 2027 and beyond.

While there are many things to love about the Fieldhouse, it’s starting to get a little tight on seating and pit space. Our program continues to grow — we’ve reached 256 teams! — and I’d love the option to expand the Florida Championship to more teams in the future.

So what can you do to help?

1. If you know of an appropriately-sized venue — and better yet, if you have contacts — please reach out to me. Remember that we have some notable requirements (it’s a dual-division event with 4 fields and at least 56 teams), so even an oversized gymnasium usually isn’t enough space. If you contact me, I’ll be happy to talk through the requirements with you. Cost will be a driving factor in many decisions.
2. If you know of anyone who might be interested in sponsoring the Florida Championship, please reach out to me.

Some of our past Florida Championship locations have come from connections made by viewers like you.

Thank you for your help. See you at an event soon!
