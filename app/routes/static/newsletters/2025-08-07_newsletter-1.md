# Florida 2025–2026 Newsletter #1

_August 7th, 2025_

Hello there,

My name is AJ Foster, and I'm honored to be the new Program Delivery Partner for _FIRST_ Tech Challenge in Florida. After more than 10 years, our previous leader, Hans Wolf, has stepped back to enjoy some well-deserved retirement. I am extremely grateful for the way Hans cared for and grew this program over the years.

We are one month away from kickoff for the 2025–2026 DECODE™ presented by RTX season. Below is some information focused on kickoff day.

## In-Person Kickoff Events

Most of our leagues will host in-person kickoff gatherings to celebrate the start of the season and watch the game reveal together. Details are still being finalized, so keep an eye on [our website](https://flfirst.org/events) and look for communication from your league leadership soon.

## Virtual Kickoff Broadcast

We will once again host a live broadcast on kickoff day featuring some new and some familiar faces. If you aren't able to attend an in-person kickoff event, I encourage you to watch the broadcast on [https://www.youtube.com/@FIRSTInFlorida](https://www.youtube.com/@FIRSTInFlorida).

## Call for Videos

What advice would you give teams to get started with the new season? We're looking for 30-second (1 minute maximum) videos with your tips. Topics could include how to evaluate game strategy, how to get started with CAD, or anything else relevant to the start of the season. Here are the guidelines:

- 30-second video (1 minute max)
- Film in landscape (for the broadcast)
- Don't include copyrighted music or video
- Post the videos publicly (e.g. YouTube public or unlisted; Google Drive) and send the link to me by Friday, August 29th.

Florida has a [history](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBXi66IgZNc) of [creative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7UXB_mEEA) videos. We can't guarantee that all submissions will be used in the show, but I'm excited to see what you come up with.

One last note: the FIRST Tech Challenge Hardship Grant is now available. Please review the criteria [here](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/team-grants) and contact me if you would like to apply.

See you soon!
