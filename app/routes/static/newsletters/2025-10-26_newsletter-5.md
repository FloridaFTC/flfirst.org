# 2025–2026 Newsletter #5: Preparing for League Meets

Hello Florida _FIRST_ Tech Challenge,

As we approach the start of League Meet events, this email contains important things to consider.

**1. Please Update FTC Apps to Version 11**

Version 11.0 of the [applications](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController) you use to control your robot has important improvements that will help you and event-day volunteers. Although _FIRST_ does not require a specific minimum version of this software, please update to version 11.0 to get these improvements.

**2. No More Field Inspection**

Previously, inspection was split between _Robot Inspection_ and _Field Inspection_. This season, there is only one unified _Inspection_ process. Review the [Inspection Checklist](https://ftc-resources.firstinspires.org/ftc/event/inspection-check) to understand where your inspectors will focus, and — if you want to be extra prepared — consider taking the Inspector training on [training.firstinspires.org](http://training.firstinspires.org/).

**3. Practice Matches**

In the absence of Field Inspection, many events will offer _Practice Matches_ as an opportunity to practice the full match process (from queueing to reset) at the beginning of your event. Read [Section 13.5](https://ftc-resources.firstinspires.org/ftc/game/manual-13) of the Competition Manual for more information, and — if you want to be extra prepared — read the _Practice Matches_ section of the [Field Operations Guide](https://ftc-resources.firstinspires.org/ftc/event/field-ops-guide) to understand more about the process.

Some important items to remember:

- Not all events are able to offer Practice Matches.
- Practice Matches can be scheduled or open, and there are different processes for each.
- Practice Matches may happen at the same time as inspection and (later in the season) judging interviews. Teams may not be able to participate in their scheduled match.
- Your event may provide a “filler line” for teams to fill open spots in scheduled matches (or to fill all slots in open matches).

This is a new process, so please be patient with your event-day volunteers.

See you at an event soon!
