# 2025-2026 Newsletter #4: Team and Volunteer Training

Hello Florida _FIRST_ Tech Challenge,

This newsletter discusses volunteer training resources, but there’s an important note for teams as well.

Training resources for mentors and most volunteer roles are now available. This season, _FIRST_ introduced a [new platform](https://training.firstinspires.org/) for training. You can access it directly (using that link), or you can use the **_FIRST_ Training** button in the Volunteer Registration section of your _FIRST_ Dashboard. It uses the same login as your _FIRST_ Dashboard account.

To get started, you’ll take the **Welcome to _FIRST_** training. Some volunteer roles also require **Data Privacy for Event Volunteers**. After that, you’re free to access any of the volunteer trainings, regardless of whether or not you’ve applied for the role. If you _View Full Catalog_, you can also find training for Mentors. If you’re curious about _FIRST_ LEGO League, _FIRST_ Robotics Competition, or other topics like XRP, you can access those trainings as well. Go wild!

**Teams**: One of the best ways to prepare for an event is to train as a volunteer. Regardless of whether or not you sign up for a role, it’s a great idea to have some of your students and mentors train in a variety of roles. I recommend starting with the **Robot Inspector** training, since this will be the first task you encounter at your first League Meet event. Later in the season, you can take the **Judge** training to understand more about the process before your League Tournament.

Get started at https://training.firstinspires.org/, and have fun.
