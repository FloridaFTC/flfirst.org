# 2025–2026 Newsletter #7: Florida Championship (Ways to Attend)

Hello Florida _FIRST_ Tech Challenge teams,

_The short version_: The Florida Championship Volunteer T-Shirt Contest and Lottery are back. If you’re interested, read the requirements below.

\~\~\~

We’re almost finished with events in 2025. That means it’s time to start looking forward to our League Tournaments and the Florida Championship event. This email contains information about the different ways to attend the Florida Championship.

**About Advancement**

56 teams will join us at the Florida Championship on March 6–7, 2026 at the AdventHealth Fieldhouse in Winter Haven. 54 of those teams will advance from our eight League Tournament events based on the [new advancement model](https://community.firstinspires.org/advancement-first-championship-update) introduced by _FIRST_ this season. (The exact number of teams advancing from each league will be announced in January.) One additional team will receive an invitation as the winner of the Volunteer T-Shirt Contest (more on that below). Finally, one additional team will receive an invitation from the team lottery (more on that too).

This season, we are fortunate to advance **9 teams** from the Florida Championship to the _FIRST_ Championship in Houston, TX, and an **additional 13 teams** to Premier Events around the world.

**Volunteer T-Shirt Contest**

This season, I’m pleased to continue the Volunteer T-Shirt Contest for teams. A design selected from team submissions will be worn by our Florida Championship volunteers, and the team that submitted the winning design will receive an invitation to the Florida Championship. This is a great chance to express your creativity and lock in an automatic invitation.

Submissions must adhere to the following guidelines:

- Use [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfK7dl8uHAvunv-E3gKvaYTy68Ew-fQH3MXohlim8UYN8ArOA/viewform?usp=header) to submit your design.
- Submitted design must be digital (no scans or photos).
- Uploaded file should be high-resolution or vector (JPEG, PNG, or SVG).
- Design should use a single foreground color.
- Design should include the text: "Florida Championship 2026"
- Design should incorporate the official DECODE™ presented by RTX logo (available [here](https://info.firstinspires.org/free-season-content)).

Submissions are due by 11:59pm ET on Saturday, January 3, 2026. I can’t wait to see what everyone comes up with!

**Florida Championship Lottery**

I’m also pleased to continue the lottery program for teams that have not recently attended the Florida Championship. Our final opening is filled with a randomly selected team, weighted by the number of seasons since their last appearance at the event.

If you are interested in participating in the team lottery, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScNxe6ZjdTZIBHb8D16u8TwuRir813BVPRpDV10FOhqUUvJag/viewform?usp=header) by 11:59pm ET on Saturday, January 3, 2026.

\~\~\~

I hope you have a relaxing new year and return excited to finish DECODE™ presented by RTX regular season play.
