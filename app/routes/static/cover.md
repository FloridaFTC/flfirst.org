The Florida <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/programs/ftc/"><i>FIRST</i> Tech Challenge</a> program is a sport for engineers. However, _FIRST_ is more than building robots. It enables middle and high school students to apply the skills they are learning it school to a sports-style robotics competition.

*FIRST* Tech Challenge teams (grades 6-12) are challenged to design, build, program, and operate robots to compete in a head-to-head challenge in an alliance/team format. The robot kit is reusable from year to year and can be coded using a variety of levels of Java-based programming. Participants are eligible to apply for **$80M+** in college scholarships.

The Florida _FIRST_ Tech Challenge program includes **256+** teams from Pensacola to Miami. Florida is organized into [leagues](/leagues) that compete in local events between October and earlier February with some teams qualifying for the Florida Championship in early March.
